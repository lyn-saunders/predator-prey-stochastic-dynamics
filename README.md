This report explores the stochastic dynamics of a predator-prey system modeled using a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Linear stability analysis is applied to investigate the deterministic behaviour of the system. Parameter conditions are applied to evaluate steady states, and numerical simulations confirm these predictions.

Gaussian white noise is added to extend the analysis to a system of stochastic differential equations. Simulations show that the populations fluctuate around the deterministic steady states. Fluctuations in the frequency domain are quantified by applying Fourier analysis, revealing key oscillatory behaviours and dependence on system parameters. The findings provide insight into the relationship between biological uncertainties and population dynamics.
